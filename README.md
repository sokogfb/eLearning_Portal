# E-Learning Portal
This E-Learning Portal started as part of a school project during my first year of master in web programming course.
The main motivation behind this choice is solving a problem that students face regarding sharing study materials, submitting assignment, doing quizzes online, communicating with professors and sharing knowledge with each other. So I thought to develop an eLearning platform where all these activities can take place. 
Most of the features are built, but future work is planning, including bug fixes and enhancements.

Tech stack used:
PHP,
